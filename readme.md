# Image Compression Tool

This is a simple image compression tool to allow batch image compression quickly and easily.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script. The script will prompt you to select a folder to compress. After the compression process is complete, you can choose to compress another folder or quit the program.

The compressed images are saved in a 'Compressed' subfolder in the selected folder.
